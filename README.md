# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
A fun game of tic-tac-toe using HTML, CSS, JS

##About:
We have developed a simple 2-player tic-tac-toe game with various features, using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

##Features:
1. Interactive Canvas on which we can add X or 0.
2. An option for a 3x3 board/ 4x4 board/ 5x5 board
3. An option for a Standard X-0 game as well as a reverse X-0 game. For reverse X-0 the player who doesn't make the 3/4/5 in a row, wins. i.e., the loser in the normal X-0, is the winner in the reverse X-0.
